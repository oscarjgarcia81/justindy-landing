# AI Deployment Agency — 15-Minute Consultation Call Script

## Pre-Call Prep (2 minutes)
- Review their website/LinkedIn
- Identify 2-3 manual processes they likely struggle with
- Check if they're B2B service, e-commerce, or professional services

---

## Opening (2 minutes)

**"Thanks for jumping on. Before we dive in — what's the one thing happening in your business right now that's eating up way too much of your time or your team's time?"**

*Let them talk. Take notes. Don't pitch yet.*

---

## The 4-Question Diagnostic (6 minutes)

**1. Current Pain**
> "Walk me through [the process they mentioned]. How are you handling that today?"

*Listen for: Manual steps, repetitive tasks, bottlenecks, errors*

**2. Cost of the Problem**
> "Roughly how many hours per week does this take? And who's doing it — you or someone on your team?"

*Calculate mentally: Hours × Hourly rate × 52 weeks = Annual cost*

**3. Impact of a Solution**
> "If that was automated and you got those hours back, what would you do with that time?"

*Listen for: Growth activities, client work, strategic projects, personal time*

**4. Past Attempts**
> "Have you tried to solve this before — either with software, hiring, or outsourcing? What happened?"

*Listen for: Failed tools, bad freelancers, budget constraints, technical debt*

---

## The Transition (2 minutes)

**"Okay, here's what I'm hearing..."**

*[Summarize their problem in their words]*

**"Based on what you've told me, this is exactly the type of work I do. I help [their industry] businesses automate [their specific pain] so they can [their desired outcome]."**

---

## Presenting the Options (3 minutes)

**"I offer two ways to work together:"**

### Option 1: Services (Most Common)
> "Most of my clients start with my **Services** — I build and run the automation on my end, you just get the results. It's a monthly retainer, fully managed, includes monitoring and updates. You don't think about the tech — it just works."

*[If they ask about price: "Typically ranges from $2,000 to $5,000 per month depending on complexity. I'll know more after I scope your specific needs."]*

### Option 2: In-House AI System (Premium)
> "If you prefer to own the hardware and have everything running in your office, I also do **In-House AI Systems**. I deliver a fully configured Mac Mini, install it at your location, train your team on how to use it, and hand you the keys. Ninety days of support included."

*[If they ask about price: "One-time investment, typically $8,000 to $15,000 depending on setup complexity."]*

## The Close (2 minutes)

**"Here's what I'd recommend as a next step..."**

**Option A — They're interested:**
> "Let me put together a custom proposal for you. I'll outline exactly what I'd automate, what the ROI looks like, and what the investment would be. I can have that to you by [tomorrow/end of week]. Does that work?"

**Option B — They're hesitant:**
> "How about this — I'll do a free AI Audit of your [specific process]. I'll map out exactly what can be automated and what the savings would be. No obligation. If it makes sense, we talk about working together. If not, you keep the audit. Sound fair?"

---

## Objection Handling

**"I need to think about it"**
> "Of course. What specific questions do you need answered? Often there's one concern we haven't covered yet."

**"It's expensive"**
> "I get it. Let's look at what this is costing you *not* to do it. [Reference the cost they told you]. The question isn't whether you can afford $X/month — it's whether you can afford to keep losing $Y/month to this problem."

**"We can do this in-house"**
> "You absolutely could. The question is: should you? Your team's expertise is in [their core business], not automation architecture. This is a 40-hour project for me — would probably take your team 2-3 weeks to research and build. What's that time worth?"

**"I need to check with my partner/team"**
> "Totally understand. What would they need to see to feel confident about this? I can tailor the proposal to address their specific concerns."

1. **Talk 30%, Listen 70%**
2. **Use their words** — don't impose jargon

4. **No hard selling** — let the ROI sell itself
5. **Always offer a next step** — proposal, audit, or follow-up call
