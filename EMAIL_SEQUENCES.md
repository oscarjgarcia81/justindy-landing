# Email Sequence Templates

## Sequence 1: Service-Based Businesses (B2B)

### Email 1 (Day 1) - Initial Outreach
```
Subject: {{Company Name}} — quick question

{{AI Personalization}}

I help {{Industry}} companies automate repetitive tasks that are eating up their team's time — things like lead follow-up, data entry, and reporting.

Recently helped a similar company save 15 hours/week with a simple automation setup.

Worth a 15-min call to see if there's a fit?

### Email 2 (Day 3) - Follow Up
```
Subject: Re: {{Company Name}} — quick question

{{Contact Name}} — wanted to bump this to the top of your inbox.

The manual work I mentioned — is that something your team is struggling with too, or have you found a solution?

Justin
```

### Email 3 (Day 7) - Breakup
```
Subject: Should I close your file?

{{Contact Name}} —

Haven't heard back, so I'll assume this isn't a priority right now.

If things change and you want to explore automation, just reply and I'll pick this back up.

## Sequence 2: Marketing Agencies (Specific)

### Email 1 (Day 1)
```
Subject: {{Company Name}} client reporting

{{Contact Name}} — 

Noticed {{Company Name}} is a {{Industry}} agency. Guessing your team spends hours every week on client reports and data pulling?

I help agencies automate reporting, lead tracking, and client onboarding — basically all the repetitive stuff that keeps your team from doing creative work.

One agency I worked with cut 12 hours/week of manual reporting.

Worth a 15-min call to see if there's something similar I could do for {{Company Name}}?

Justin
```

### Email 2 (Day 3)
```
Subject: Re: {{Company Name}} client reporting

{{Contact Name}} —

Quick follow-up on the reporting automation I mentioned.

Are you guys still doing most of that manually, or have you found tools that actually work?

Justin
```

### Email 3 (Day 7)
```
Subject: Should I close your file?

{{Contact Name}} —

Haven't heard back, so I'll assume automation isn't a priority for {{Company Name}} right now.

If that changes down the road, feel free to reach out.

Justin

## Sequence 3: Operations/Admin Focus

### Email 1 (Day 1)
```
Subject: {{Company Name}} operations

{{Contact Name}} —

Saw {{Company Name}} is hiring for operations roles. Usually means the team's drowning in manual processes.

I help companies like yours automate the repetitive stuff — data entry, scheduling, follow-ups — so your ops people can focus on actual strategy.

Worth a quick call to see what could be automated at {{Company Name}}?

Justin
```

### Email 2 (Day 3)
```
Subject: Re: {{Company Name}} operations

{{Contact Name}} —

Wanted to check in on my last email about automation.

What are the biggest time-wasters your ops team deals with right now?

Justin
```

### Email 3 (Day 7)
```
Subject: Closing your file

{{Contact Name}} —

No worries if this isn't the right time. I'll close your file for now.

If automation becomes a priority later, just reply and I'll pick this back up.

Justin
```

## Sequence 4: Competitor Intelligence (Your Proven Offer)

### Email 1 (Day 1)
```
Subject: {{Company Name}} — competitor monitoring

{{Contact Name}} —

Quick question: How does {{Company Name}} currently track what competitors are doing?

I help companies set up automated competitor intelligence — daily reports on competitor pricing, new offerings, and market moves.

Recently built this for a service company in {{Industry}}. They went from "we think we know what competitors are doing" to having actual data every morning.

Worth 15 minutes to see if this would work for {{Company Name}}?

Justin
```

### Email 2 (Day 3)
```
Subject: Re: {{Company Name}} — competitor monitoring

{{Contact Name}} —

Following up on the competitor monitoring I mentioned.

Are you guys tracking competitors manually right now, or do you have something automated in place?

Justin
```

### Email 3 (Day 7)
```
Subject: Should I close your file?

{{Contact Name}} —

Haven't heard back on the competitor intelligence offering.

I'll close your file for now — if this becomes relevant later, just reply.

Justin
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always use AI personalization** — First line should reference something specific
2. **Keep it short** — 3-5 sentences max
3. **One ask** — Only ask for a 15-min call
4. **No links in first email** — Hurts deliverability
5. **Conversational tone** — Not salesy
6. **Mobile-friendly** — Most read on phone
