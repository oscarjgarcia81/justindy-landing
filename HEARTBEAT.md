# HEARTBEAT.md

# Keep this file empty (or with only comments) to skip heartbeat API calls.

# Add tasks below when you want the agent to check something periodically.

## Daily Checks

- [ ] Read NOTES.md and check for any dated notes due today or tomorrow
- [ ] If upcoming note found: Alert Justin with the note details
- [ ] Read memory files for recent context

## Heartbeat Rules

1. Check NOTES.md for dated entries
2. If due date is today or tomorrow → Alert Justin
3. If no urgent notes → Reply HEARTBEAT_OK
4. Don't repeat old alerts from prior heartbeats
